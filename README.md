# ToDo_List_Chrome_Extension

Download the Extension Files:

If you have the extension's .zip file or source files, ensure they are unzipped. You should have the extension's manifest file (manifest.json) along with other necessary files like images, scripts, etc.
Open Chrome's Extensions Page:

Open Google Chrome.
In the address bar, type chrome://extensions/ and press Enter.
This will open the Extensions page where all installed extensions are listed.
Enable Developer Mode:

In the top right corner of the Extensions page, toggle the Developer mode switch to On.
Load the Unpacked Extension:

Click on the Load unpacked button.
A file dialog will appear. Navigate to the folder where your extension files are located and select the folder (not just a .zip file).
Select the folder and click Open. This will install the extension manually.
Verify Installation:

The extension should now be visible on the Extensions page (chrome://extensions/).
If needed, you can toggle it on or off, or remove it.
